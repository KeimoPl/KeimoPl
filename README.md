# 👋 Hey, I’m Keimo

I build things **fast, clean, and smart**. I like to **think about what could go wrong**, analyze it, and then **turn it into something that just works**. Automation is my playground, and every project is a tiny experiment in making life easier.  

> “If it can be automated, it will be automated.” – probably me 😎

## 🚀 My Style

- I **analyze everything** before building  
- I build **fast, reliable, and clean code**  
- I learn by **creating small experiments** that grow over time

I may not have “world-changing” projects… yet. But here’s where I experiment, learn:  

- **[Website Project](https://3dpudiwebsitedesign.keimo-plaas22.workers.dev/)** – I made a website for a company

> Every small project is a step toward bigger, smarter solutions 🌱
